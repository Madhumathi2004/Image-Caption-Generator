# Image-Caption-Generator

An image caption generator project involves creating a system that automatically generates descriptive text for images. It takes image as an input and generates captions for image.The project typically uses deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) like RESNET50 to process the image and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) like LSTMs to generate the text captions for an image.
